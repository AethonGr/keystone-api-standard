The `organization` folder contains APIs and access logic for managing organization-related operations. This includes querying organization data, updating organization details, and handling organization-specific business logic.

## Contents

- **`organization_api.py`**: Defines the API endpoints for interacting with organization-related data.
- **`organization_access.py`**: Contains the access logic for querying and manipulating organization data.

## Features

- Retrieve organization details through well-defined API endpoints.
- Update organization information using structured access logic.
- Manage organization-related operations with modular and reusable components.

## Usage

1. **Review the API Endpoints**: 
   - Open `organization_api.py` to understand the available APIs and their functionalities.
   - These APIs are designed to provide a consistent interface for interacting with organization data.

2. **Leverage Access Logic**:
   - Use the functions and methods in `organization_access.py` to interact with the data models.
   - The access logic ensures that all data operations are performed in a standardized and efficient manner.

3. **Customization**:
   - Modify the access logic in `organization_access.py` to meet specific requirements.
   - Ensure that any changes are consistent with the overall API structure and do not break existing functionality.

## Notes

- This folder is dedicated to organization-related operations and is designed to be modular and extensible.
- Any changes made to the APIs or access logic should be thoroughly tested to ensure compatibility with the rest of the system.
- Follow the project’s coding standards and guidelines to maintain consistency and readability.

By maintaining a clear separation between APIs and access logic, this folder ensures that organization-related functionalities are easy to manage, and integrate into the broader API framework.
