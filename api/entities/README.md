The `entities` folder contains APIs, access scripts and logic for querying and managing data. Each subfolder focuses on a specific domain, such as transport operations, drivers, or vehicles. These subfolders include APIs and modular access logic specific to their respective domains.

## Subfolders

- **`driver/`**: Contains APIs and modular access logic for managing driver-related operations.
- **`vehicle/`**: Contains APIs and modular access logic for managing vehicle-related operations.
- **`transport_operation/`**: Contains APIs and modular access logic for managing transport operation-related operations.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the relevant subfolder based on the domain you want to manage.
2. Review the APIs provided in the subfolder.
3. Implement the access logic to query and manipulate data as per your requirements.
4. Ensure that the access logic is properly linked to the endpoints and data models.

## Notes

This folder provides a modular approach to managing data access logic, making it easier to maintain and extend the API. While the access logic is modular, the API files themselves are structured to provide a consistent interface across all domains.
