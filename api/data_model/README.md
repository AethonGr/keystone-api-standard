The `data_model` folder contains the data models used throughout the KEYSTONE API Standard. These models define the structure and validation rules for entities such as transport operations, drivers, vehicles, and related entities.

## Contents

- **Data Model**: Python classes that represent the entities used in the APIs.
- **Validation Rules**: Constraints and rules to ensure data integrity.

## Guidance for Users

1. **Understanding the Model**: The data model in this folder are designed to provide a strict and standardized structure for all entities used in the API. Users should familiarize themselves with these models to understand how data is represented and validated.
2. **Integration**: They serve as the foundation for ensuring that all data conforms to the expected structure and rules.
