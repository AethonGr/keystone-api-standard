# DEMONSTRATION

The `utils` folder contains utility modules that support the implementation of the KEYSTONE API Standard. These modules are designed to simplify common tasks and provide reusable functionality for the testing server implementations.

## Contents

- **`access_utils.py`**: This utility is used to simulate database interactions in the demonstration servers.

## Notes

- The utility is intended for demonstration purposes only and may not be suitable for production use. It is also designed to work with JSON files as a lightweight data storage mechanism for testing.
