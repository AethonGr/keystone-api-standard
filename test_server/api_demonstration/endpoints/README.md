# DEMONSTRATION

The `endpoints` folder contains endpoint definitions for the API endpoints. These endpoints map API paths to their corresponding functionalities, ensuring a clear and organized structure for handling requests.

## Contents

- **Transport Operations Endpoints**: Defines endpoints for managing transport operations.
- **Driver Endpoints**: Defines endpoints for managing driver-related data.
- **Vehicle Endpoints**: Defines endpoints for managing vehicle-related data.

## Usage

1. Review the endpoint definitions to understand the API structure.
2. Select and use only the endpoints that are relevant to your specific requirements.
3. Ensure that each endpoint is properly linked to its corresponding logic in the `categories` folder.

## Notes 

- This folder provides a modular approach to managing API paths, making it easier to maintain the APIs. 
- Users have the flexibility to implement only the endpoints they need, simplifying integration and customization.
