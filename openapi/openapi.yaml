    **KEYSTONE API Standard** OpenAPI Specification is developed by [AETHON Engineering](https://aethon.gr/) as part of the [KEYSTONE project](https://www.keystone-project.com/) ([CORDIS: 101103740](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101103740)), an initiative funded by the European Union’s Horizon Europe programme under the auspices of **DG CINEA** (European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency). This standard is designed to facilitate seamless data exchange within the logistics sector through a set of RESTful APIs.

    It enables streamlined integration across multiple stakeholders, including logistics companies, enforcement agencies, vehicle operators, drivers, and other entities engaged in transport operations.

    This standard supports interoperability and digitalization across the European transport ecosystem.

    ## Relationship between the KEYSTONE API Standard and Integrating Systems
    The relationship between the KEYSTONE API Standard and the integrating systems can be conceptually illustrated as follows:

    **Figure: API Interaction between Producer and Consumer Systems via Keystone API Standard**

    Conceptually, the KEYSTONE API Standard works as a guidance framework: every Data Producer designs their API according to the shared rules, and every Data Consumer queries APIs that adhere to this guidance. This align-to-the-standard approach replaces tangled point-to-point integrations with a scalable, maintainable architecture. Supplementary tools, like client libraries and modular access scripts, further streamline development, making implementation faster and less error-prone.

    ## Key Features
    - **Transport Operations**: Manage and track transport operations, including real-time data for transportation phases, route planning, and logistics coordination. This also includes the integration of the eCMR, provided by [Open Logistics Foundation](https://openlogisticsfoundation.org/ecmr/) (v0.1) under the [Open Logistics Foundation License v1.3](https://www.openlogisticsfoundation.org/licenses/).
    - **Vehicle Information**: Access data related to vehicles used in transport operations, including geolocation, registration details, and maintenance status.
    - **Driver Information**: Retrieve driver data, including qualifications, licenses, tachograph cards, and violation records.
    - **Organization Information**: Provides organization information for logistics operators, shippers, and receivers.

    This specification ensures that users can integrate the **KEYSTONE API Standard** into their systems, enabling smooth, seamless, and secure communication within the logistics ecosystem.

    ## API Structure
    The **KEYSTONE API Standard** is divided into the following main categories of endpoints:
    - **Transport Operations**: Covers all aspects of managing and tracking transport operations, including the management of eCMRs.
    - **Vehicles**: Provides access to detailed vehicle data, including geolocation and status.
    - **Drivers**: Includes information about driver qualifications, licenses, and traffic violations.
    - **Organizations**: Manages organization data for logistics operators, shippers, and receivers.

    Each path supports operations such as:
    - **Create (POST)**: Add new data.
    - **Retrieve (GET)**: Fetch existing data.
    - **Update (PUT)**: Replace the entire resource.
    - **Partial Update (PATCH)**: Modify specific fields.
    - **Delete (DELETE)**: Remove data.

    ## Tags
    The API uses tags to categorize endpoints into logical groups:
    - **Transport Operation**: Endpoints for managing transport operations, including schedules, phases, and documents.
    - **Vehicle**: Endpoints for vehicle management, including geolocation, registration, and maintenance.
    - **Driver**: Endpoints for managing driver-related information, such as license and violations.
    - **Organization**: Endpoints for managing organization data, including logistics operators, shippers, and receivers.

    ## Paths
    The API defines the following key paths and operations:
